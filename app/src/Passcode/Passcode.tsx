          Robots Building Education 4.0 is in an experimental phase. Most users
          that I target will not have the ability to log in until they
          understand how Bitcoin works more. It's my goal to reduce friction and
          improve the user experience.

            As mentioned below, we will need to install tools in order to fund
            our devices with cash and Bitcoin. You mostly need a phone and/or
            email along to get these services, since they're privacy focused.
            You might "mess up" along the way. That's okay. That's part of the
            learning process. Have fun with it an explore concepts. Ask ChatGPT

          <h4>About Bitcoin</h4>
          First and foremost, Bitcoin is many things. It allows you to use money
          online privately like you would use cash. It also gives developers
          greater control over how it works online with code.
          <br />
          <br />I recommend to think about Bitcoin like it's property. Basically
          if you own some Bitcoin, you should be careful about how, when and
          where you spend it. So today you're probably buying Bitcoin with cash
          and you're thinking of using it on my platform because I'm hoping to
          give you something as valuable with knowledge.

          <h4>Network Layers</h4>
          <p>
            In short, the bigger the layer, the farther you are away from the
            Bitcoin miners, who are responsible for the creation of Bitcoin.
            Proof-of-work is the philosophy that governs Bitcoin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <b>Layer 4</b> network appears to be decentralized applications
            and services. These are networks designed to collect SATs, which are
            the cents of Bitcoin. This includes Robots Building Education.
            Remember how I said to think carefully before spending Bitcoin?
            Think of payment as a way to grant people to make the internet
            better.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <b>Layer 3</b> network are popular money networks Americans use
            to buy Bitcoin and move dollars. Cash App, Coinbase and other mobile
            app are common custodial solution. You connect your bank account and
            primarily use the Visa, Mastercard and software networks to access
            to things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Layer 2</b> networks include services like Strike (mobile) and
            Alby (web browser), which let you move Bitcoin across devices. The
            most popular layer 2 network is called Lightning, which is a
            decentralized version of Visa or Mastercard. For most people, this
            means buying Bitcoin on Cash App, moving it to your Strike wallet
            and then moving that bitcoin to your web browser wallet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Layer 1</b> is the Bitcoin network. This is where we look at
            Bitcoin as technological abstractions of money systems like gold and
            treasury. Fees are high, so this longterm means that transaction on
            the layer 1 network is expensive but can move large sums of money.
