## Understanding The Folders

## Understanding The Files

`App.compute.ts` ⚙️
This TypeScript file is where we put logic that's too complex for the UI components. Think of it as the place for heavy lifting operations. They store functions in the App component and beyond.

`App.constants.ts` 📚
Constants are unchanging values used throughout our app. This file is like a record, keeping our code consistent and organized.

`App.css` 🖌️
CSS files add style to our web pages. App.css is where we define the look and feel of our application, making it visually appealing. Since CSS is in cascading order, this is used as an app-wide sheet. Generated by Vite.

`App.hooks.tsx` 🪄
Hooks are a feature of React that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. App.hooks.tsx is where we define these reusable stateful functions like `useZap`

`App.tsx` 📱
This is the main React component file that represents the core of your application. It ties everything together and is the entry point to the product. Generated by Vite.

`InstallPWA.tsx` 🔮
This file helps in making your web app installable as a Progressive Web App, combining the best of web and mobile apps. It is not currently in use.

`MohyMap.tsx` 🗺️
An experimental feature that let's people work through a decision map to select algorithms that solve common problem sets.

`Store.ts` 📦
Manages the application's global state using Zustand. Currently manages the bitcoin zap animation.

`WalletAuth.tsx` 🔐
This component handles authentication using Bitcoin wallet's in order to access the lightning network. (Optional version of the app for users)

`index.css` ⬇️
Global styles that apply to the entire app go here, setting the foundation for your app's design. App and index files tend to share similar influence as app-wide files. What's the difference? the index file cares more about html while the app.css file cares more about the app component files. Index is a lower level. Generated by vite.

`index.d.ts` - The Glossary 📖
TypeScript definition files that help your development environment understand the types of your project's variables. Generated by vite.

`index.js` 🌐
Experimental file that works with web5's API. Not in use.

`main.tsx` - The Starter 🔑
Similar to App.tsx, this file is often used to bootstrap the app and might include setup and additional configurations. Generated by Vite.

`vite-env.d.ts` - The Environment Whisperer 🌍
Contains type declarations for Vite's environment variables, helping ensure that you use them correctly throughout your app. Generated by vite.
