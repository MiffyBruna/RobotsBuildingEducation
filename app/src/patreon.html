    <em><u>About me</u></em>
</p>
<p style>
    I created Robots Building Education because I believed that the future of
    education boils down to three key things:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p style>Every student should have access to many best-fit teachers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style>
            An inordinate amount of education and inequitable learning happens on
            social media. Unrecorded education or learning is a systemic failure.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p style>Learning events should build communities.</p>
        <p style></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p style>
    Who am I? I'm a person that moved from Chicago to the Bay Area to find work as a software engineer. I spent some
    time working on education and financial technology and created an audience on Tiktok by promoting hard but honest
    work. Now I work on my ideas with Robots Building Education.
</p>
<p></p>

<p style>
    Why do I do this? I just believe that the world should work a certain way and I want to live my truth. I feel that
    education technology has been generations behind other forms of media.
    The internet should be better. I'm not here to promise you success but I am here to try my best to provide an
    environment that can help you create it.
