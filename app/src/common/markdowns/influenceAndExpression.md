So before beginning, let’s quickly go through my experience on the subject. I’ve been using internet forums for about 20 years. The first one I really participated in was called GameFAQs.

The first time I was ever introduced to search engine optimization (SEO) was through my brother after he completed a bachelors in marketing and communications in 2014. SEO is a marketing technology that people use to understand and grow their rank, relevance, and recommendation results on platforms like Google or Tiktok.

That’s what internet forums and social media are - they’re communication experiences built on top of communication technology. To reinforce that knowledge, I studied computer science with a focus on human-computer interaction, which you may recognize as user interface design and user experience research.

To me, social media is an expression of a generational barrier. It’s one of those things you can get good at so that you can move on to bigger ideas in your life.

Clearly, internet forums change in shape and format and this is something that an organization like Meta tries to account for. These days I have quite the appreciation for the algorithmic experiences driven by platforms like TikTok and Pinterest.

It’s intersectional with a lot of the things I’ve studied formally. If you’re going to remember one thing from this bit of knowledge, you ought to remember that things are sorted by what the platform considers relevant.

Social media algorithms are informed by their design. For Twitter, it’s your voice in a global chatroom. For Pinterest, it’s ideas, planning and shopping. You get the point. Pinterest will never be as effective of a political platform as a place like Twitter and Twitter will not really capture the essence of women’s shopping needs the same way either.

I think many of us grew up in a time where we differentiated between Google Search and some Social Media, but the truth is they have all always been the same at the consumer level. It’s us connecting information on communication platforms.

Tangentially, I’m a big believer in the metaverse. Online gaming has always been on the cutting edge of communication technology and experiences. To me, the metaverse is computing built from a social perspective rather than the default mode we got, which was personal computing.

It is a social computer. We aren’t really used to it just yet, but some of the ways we do things today will be seen as really clunky or limited. I imagine that a social computer is largely driven by experiences and AI, which if you pause to ponder, is what drives social media today.

Well, these experiences will continue to expand in depth, as we’ve seen with conversational AIs and AI artistry in recent months.

As a result of this relevance-dominant communication, many of us will often start by using naive advice. You’ve heard it all before:

Use a select amount of hashtags

Follow trends

Find a niche

Find a theme

Use an effective hook, body, and call to action

Use keywords and captions for SEO

Use a social media strategy

BE AUTHENTIC!

All of these are true enough that they’re worth practicing to a degree, but they aren’t clear drivers for growth. They’re practices. Growth requires an intersectional understanding between the nature of media, its consumers and its producers. Here are some other pieces of advice you may not often hear at the naive level:

Sex sells

Opinions create conversations

Disagreements create conditions for success

Be psychologically aware of your audience’s collective unconscious

Embed archetypical thoughts

Master ability to title and brand

These are true for the same reason - we’re participating in a communication platform.

I could write a book poetically explaining each concept but really that’s all a giant waste of time in comparison to what you really need. So here’s the real secret to growing on social media. You need to decolonize your mind. What the fuck does that mean, man?

This is a complicated thing because it means a lot of different things for different people, and frankly, I’m not the best at it either. So here’s what I know:

A good model to examine is your classic rockstar or an artist like Cardi B. They do things to command a certain presence and attention in and outside of a performance, and the dynamic between the two is what creates a following audience. The key thing is not that they don’t give a fuck.

They care a lot about their image. The key thing is that they allow themselves to express themselves with confidence and will attempt to actualize their ideas strategically and repeatedly. They chase. It’s not easy to show up regularly like that.

One experiment I like to do is to ask an individual whether or not they can create a video and post it publicly while seriously claiming that they can change the world. Many people find that it’s not as easy as it appears in their first take.

One thing that I need to pay attention to as an expert in human-computer interaction is the user experience. It’s synonymous with the human or student experience. This is the ultimate zone of education. A student’s experience is always a multidimensional problem.

Given that most of us are Latino, I think we can all sympathize to a degree that our “Latino experience” is driven by frictional conversations of race, survival, sexuality, history and other cultural concepts. We can all relate to the complex time we live in, where we will have to address significant but personal conversations about clinical depression, ambition, the other so-called “generational curses”.

I try to weave into the conversations that folks ought to examine the quality of their self-esteem and self-talk before addressing clinical subjects. This can either direct them to a healthier life or it can direct them to better handle and manage their clinical experiences.

The difficult point that I’m trying to connect here is that there is an underbelly of shame that is embedded in our cultural and lived experience in the US. That shame harms the quality of our thoughts. Having a good recognition of that is a deeply empowering thing, and in my view, it allows you to expand your voice, expression and resilience.

Some of these instances and the impact of shaming are historically clear, like the public lynching of George Floyd, while others may be pretty subtle, like adoption of a nickname to make life easier. In my view, shame is one of those concepts that drives people to not believe that they can perform in math courses, express themselves as artists or achieve political and financial influence.

It is abundant in the modern day and it’s worthwhile to consider your views and opinions of history, its impact on the modern day and the outlook of the future you envision. History is one of those things that is omnipresent. There is no escaping it.

It’s always being created and you are always participating in it. So it’s a worthwhile thing to reflect on. That’s what “decolonization” is, it’s an attempt to engage outside of your default-mode in your default-setting.

With that being said, the other important thing to do is to iterate and experiment. I’ve recently advised folks to read Shitty First Drafts by Anne Lamott since I feel that is a good starting point to embrace self-expression without concern for vulnerability and imperfection.

It’s easier to continuously iterate, destroy and improve an idea when you have a vision to work toward. Scientists do this. They embrace failure so that they can observe, analyze and improve. The final result is often after a series of different challenges and solutions.

And with the combination of those two things, I feel that it allows creators to create things to influence and inspire because you start to create more soulful or purposeful material. You may start with a niche, but you ought to work hard to break out of that barrier and into a wider domain of knowledge.

If you’re sorting by relevance, you’ll almost always tap into cultural identities, unconscious unities and activist thinking. This is why I usually stand in a position to encourage others. People ought to speak loudly and embrace the consequences of doing so. People should fail faster too.

It’s not easy and some people are better than others in their delivery or interest. But I think this practice allows just about anyone to begin a journey and find success. I think one way or another, any creator ends up going through this process anyway, and awareness of some things is sometimes what allows people to make the leaps that they’re capable of making.

I encourage people often to try to do what is right in alignment with what they seek out of their creative experience. For me, it’s going hard on the paint. FLOCKA.
