## Gaining Experience

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/201503616-1c8ba6f4-3697-44d9-be7f-ecd227a3f087.png" width=100% />

I'm choosing **Educate** as the project to assist others to gain experience. I've built a demo version of it many years here: [Appletree.io](https://appletree.io). It's an application where teachers can share resources and collaborate together, much like Github.

The assignment/tasks are meant to be challenging and they're designed for real-world skills learning, but they can be figured out by a beginner that has learned the previous material. It will require you to understand Github, which I have not made introductory tutorials on yet. If you are seeking real-world experience or project experience for your resume, please work on these while I work on "Learn" by myself. I will be happy to be a point of contact/reference on your job applications and can confirm your work to employers.

Long term, I hope to have a stronger pipeline with industry recruiters. I'm working on that.

## FAQ

1. What coding bootcamp or certification should I get to break into tech?

This depends on your situation. I think its helpful to reconsider all of your options after understanding why people choose different pathways of studying and what you ought to do in any situation. You need to be the CEO of you.

Your primary goal should be to expand your network. You have to assume that learning your qualified skills is a given, so it's not much of a competitive edge even if skills are in demand.

Bootcamps have varying levels of success and they're expensive for-profit schools. People go to them because of the promise of employment. But what happens in a tech recession with hiring freezes and layoffs?

They have their benefits and consequences. Community colleges are also challenging - the employment network may not be there based on the reputation of the school. Credits may not transfer. Self-teaching becomes a question of having no start or finish line. So what do you do?

Remember, you're the CEO of you. So either path you pick. Whether you decide to go to Harvard or you decide to teach yourself for free on Youtube, you're going to have to acquire education, build your network, build projects and find experience to compete safely against other people.

I recommend bootcamps and certifications if you're a parent or someone who can absolutely not afford the time to study at a college or university.

I recommend a college or university study. I also encourage you to learn how to code. You don't have to pursue computer science. You can study business, or psychology, or biology. It doesn't matter. Coding and computer science just integrates and enhances with everything.

2. _What got you started?_

I was studying business at UIC and eventually had to retake some math courses. I found it kind of frustrating given that I had studied Pre-calculus honors and skipped Calculus in high school for statistics. My counselor could not support my interest to study statistics and did not inform me about computer science and machine learning.

I considered computer science, but was overwhelmed by the amount of math I needed to catch up on and do.

At 19 I dropped out. It was a bender. I started working in a factory and my appreciation for machine and robotics grew as a result. I went back to community college to study mechanical engineering. I was learning some math online and discovered Khan Academy.

I was fascinated by the whole institution and who was driving it and took a stronger interest in education technology in particular. This made me switch my journey from mechanical engineering to computer science.

I went on to study computer science with the intention of developing education technology, inspired by Khan Academy. A lot of it was reinforced since I transferred to a "teacher's" university and was much more involved in sociological studies.

My study of computer science matured into an interest in human-computer interaction or more commonly known as UI/UX (user interfaces and user experiences).

So I started to work on Robots Building Education some time between 2014 and 2015 in community college and made it an expression of my own education. You can see an early version of it here: https://triton-cis-190.org/zepeda/desktop/index.html

As you can see, not much has actually changed in the past 7-8 years. That's kind of intentional. Part of my belief with this idea is that it takes time to understand how to do it correctly.

3. _Which programming language?_

The most popular ones are Javascript and Python because that's what the web is huge by volume. But the answer is it depends on what kind of machines you want to work on. For the most part, most programming languages are similar, so there's a lot of transferrable skills.

It's actually a lot like music, where a musician may know multiple tools or instrumentals because their foundations are well studied. From a computer science perspective, programming languages may have some specific nuances that are important based on what you're trying to build - which again goes back to why I suggest you take the time to understand what kind of machines you want to work on.

4. _Income expectaions?_

You can make well over 7+ figures working in tech. However, my general rule of thumb is that you can afford a family on one income. That's a pretty good situation to be in.

5. _Are you Democrat or Republican?_

I'm neither.

## Investor Relations

Currently, this is run by one person and it's intentionally done this way. To understand some core philosophy that guides me, I recommend to read the following books:

1. The One World Schoolhouse by Salman Khan (Khan Academy)
2. Teaching Community: A Pedagogy Of Hope (bell hooks)
3. Race After Technology (Rahu Benjamin)

I'm largely inspired by Khan Academy and have been for many years. I think there can be different approaches to contribute to solving the same problem. Khan Academy did an excellent job becoming an adjacent and supportive element to public education and started from the classroom.

I'm not doing that. I'm starting at the community. So my concerns are different. I'm not concerned with schedule. I'm not concerned with administrative standards. My concern is the experience of a kid growing up in a barrio and the disenfranchisement that comes with it.

So I care about creating scholarships. I care about making students feel like their learning is significant and important to others. I care about empowering communities through the individuals that exist in it. It's more of a counter-culture in some ways and admittedly it's not easy given how corporatized public and private relationships are.

So given that, right now, I feel like it's important to focus on creating a healthy scholarship fund and engaging with the community that way. The community ought to feel responsible for it, not simply granted it. They worked to create that environment. It belongs to them.

But at the end of the day, here are the significant implementations I would like to work on:

1. Embedding scholarships in digital education
2. Access to many best fit teachers
3. Expanding social media to acreddit more education (verifiable credentials)

Incubating: 4. Educator's collaborative cloud 5. Financial & civic Engagement

If you're interested in investing in me, then to be totally honest I'm not really sure what the best approach would be. I intentionally try to run with the lowest economy possible although I suppose doing this full-time would be more impactful. At the same time, working on my own means I can operate on my own, i can fail faster and i can take risks that i otherwise couldn't with someone else.

I could probably go pretty hard but I never really considered outside influence in the process. I always felt like I just needed to tap into the culture the right way with the right amount of effort to make something happen and the pipelines created from that approach are more organic and resilient. its slow though, but that might not be true in the future.

# Resume Assignment 1

As you saw in the videos, creating a project is as simple as installing a few programs and running a command. Which is basically as easy as downloading a game and clicking on it to launch it.

#### Assignment ethos

let's consider a few things to define our work culture. You're treated as a software engineer. So view yourself as one and don't deny yourself of that even if you're a student or self-teaching. So some things will be demanded of you but we also want to create a safe environment.

So if you think a question is stupid - please ask it. Those are by far the most important questions. I don't care if you say "What should I Google?". That's an amazing question.

Feel free to ask questions, ask for resources, or use Google/Youtube and other places to help you grow your knowledge. Nothing here is beyond your capacity to learn, understand and build. Assignments persist over time. Engage with them to see the progress of this application. Contribute to them, even if they're already answered, to gain experience or expand knowledge.

You are encouraged to attempt, fail and grow here. As always, if it feels like you're not good enough, then you're definitely in the right place and need to keep moving forward.

#### Assignment

1. As you can see, the project is empty. There's are some random things we need to do to setup our project for personal and team use. Feel free to explore or suggest those things in a pull request. Report back what you think. That will count as valid work.

2. How are we going to initialize our React application? Will we use something like `create-react-app`? Why or why not? Should we use an entire product like Hydrogen by Shopify? What are the tradeoffs of our choices? There is no wrong answer here. Only justifications for what you believe as an engineer.

#### What you need to accomplish this task

[Example of a pull request and branch](https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/pull/2)

Things you will need to do:

- Learn what branches or forks are on Github
