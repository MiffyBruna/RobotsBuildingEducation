## 1. Creating Purpose

This is the current email that I'm responding with. It comes from the right place and addresses many different experiences that I think is commonly shared among these emails. At times, some folks messages are a mirror reflection of what is said here.

My resume and LinkedIn is attached with the email, but is kept private here on Patreon.

A Letter To You

I took some time to think about it. I believed it was best to start this engagement by writing a letter to you. I’ve received many messages that I wanted to take some time with because these kinds of conversations and connections are important to me.

So first I want to start off by saying thanks. A real mil gracias! You guys have said some wonderful, thoughtful and nice things. I think it’s a beautiful thing that you decided to reach out to me and I would be lying if I don’t feel some kind of love for you for even trying.

Please feel free to connect with me privately on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheilfer

I know that this isn't the case for everyone, but the original message had reached out to Latino students that had dropped out of school. I’m aware that the nature of the story is that this would also target other students of color or folks that can relate to non-traditional struggles in their journeys to live a happy and stable life. You are also a very real part of this message.

I think that we often forget that diversity is an environment of inclusion and although your experience may be different, your struggle or desire for safety is not. This must be true because you would otherwise not be here.

The truth is that receiving an education can be complicated for some and not for others. The reality is that it’s likely complicated for you. When you’re in an oppressed position, it’ll mostly feel like you’re kinda just used to this specific but gentle indifference of life.

Most things are more out of your control and will impact you more than they ought to. We call this instability.

The chips are pretty much stacked against you too. If we’re being straight up about how complicated this is, some of you probably go through so pretty \*\*\*\*ed up things or end up in the wrong kind of places.

Some of you probably go through things you shouldn’t, but can’t even identify that you shouldn’t. A very common example of this is believing that you’re not smart enough to accomplish something.

An education based in love, safety and care would address those things fairly, gently and create a path for you to succeed. This is why I made the statement earlier about oppression. If this is your experience, then you are facing an injustice.

The other truth is that it’s not an absolute thing. Education is always there and its existence is meant to empower you - not employ you. What does this mean? It means if you believe that you can accomplish something then you probably can.

It’s important to realize that once you draw your purpose, you will end up studying and learning what you need to study and learn rather than fitting some kind of structure where you only “do what you studied”. You can study multiple things, be multiple things, and have multiple careers.

So how do you find purpose? What I like to tell people is that they need to spend some honest time with themselves somewhere they feel safe, alone and without judgment. Take some time and think about what you want your life to be like.

Really ask yourself what problem you want to solve or what problem you want to contribute to solving. It’s important not to judge yourself because you want to think big, dream big and envision a long-term challenge. There’s a sense of purpose and belief that I often practice.

You will need this resilience because it can just be complicated and the system is not built in your favor.

You may have an unwelcoming commute. Your financial and living situation may be unsupportive. You may have to work part or full-time and cut into opportunities in your education. The quality of your teachers could be better. Career fairs may be low opportunity.

Your family may not know how to even have conversations about your challenges. The reason you feel lesser than is because the system is built in a way to disenfranchise or discourage you. But it’s not true.

I can’t determine what your conditions are, but I know that they’re all very real and very different for everyone involved. The world today is a lot different than it was many years ago and it’s just so critical to be an advocate for yourself.

That’s it. That’s the ultimate recipe for success in education. You need inspiration, belief and resilience for your vision. You need to use fear as an advantage and opportunity to fail upward. You need to view the process as advocacy and empowerment.

It doesn’t matter if you fail with that in your worldview. Failure only becomes a minor but meaningful setback in the larger experience that is your life. That’s YHLQMDLG - yo hago lo que me da la gana.

Robots Building Education (RO.B.E)

So what the hell is this man? It’s an idea that I started to develop in 2014 when I first learned how to code using the mental model that I just explained to you. I felt that education on the internet could be better and more meaningful.

I also feel that policies surrounding education and equity are incorrect and would like to work on solving those problems. In some ways, I consider myself and RO.B.E as a form of political activism. But that’s neither here nor now.

Why is it that a student that has spent time succeeding in Calculus III that drops out gets treated as if they had never received an education? It seems like an injustice. Robots Building Education is a software-defined network that examines where technology should really belong in the education process.

Currently there are only two fundamental beliefs:

A student should have access to a network of best-fit teachers (access).
The time you spend learning online should directly and immediately support other learning communities financially (equity)
I am currently learning about the third, and hopefully last fundamental, which addresses some subjects related to student data, identity and justice in scheduling.

Learning To Code

Take some time to think about what machines you want to work with. Picking a language doesn’t box you into a path, because most programming languages are quite similar in practice. It’s mostly what machines and why you want to work with those machines.

Want to work with people? React, UI/UX
Want to work with the brains of the internet? Python
Want to work with some robotics or graphics? C++
Want to work with IoT? Java (Android) or Swift (iOS)

Ultimately, I teach Javascript and fall under category 1 with Robots Building Education. What I’m trying to accomplish in the near-term is to develop playlists on TikTok that help people go from nothing to understanding what they generally have to learn to compete - so that they can ask less random questions and spend less time getting discouraged or overwhelmed trying to learn too much.

I’m pretty good at teaching, and I try to cover many years of study in a few minutes by making it relatable.

I’ll get better at it over time and the quality will always try to go upward, even if I’ve made a video on the subject before. Longterm, I hope to fulfill the ability to have access to best-fit teachers using an algorithm like Tiktok’s.

These videos address many FAQ along the way that you’ll have. It gets you started on knowing what interviews will challenge you on, how to think about code so that you can build products, start businesses and find your way into stronger educational facilities.

## 2. Creating Duty

A Letter To You II
Hello,

Thank you for applying. I’m writing a letter as a way to address the time taken to apply to
scholarships that are being created with Robots Building Education. I feel that writing a letter is
the most fair thing that can be done for now, although I would do more if it were manageable. I
believe it will be in the future.

As far as the application goes, please remember that your application remains. I have a certain
process for selection and truthfully I don’t know what the selection process for the following
months will look like, I just know that I have a duty to perform tasks in a reasonable and fair way.
I can let you know that the selection process is a bit of a story. So that’s why I can’t determine
what the exact process will be in the future. For that reason, you’re even allowed to configure
your story in the future if you feel compelled to. So thank you for applying. There are many
incredible stories shared and it’s a privilege to be trusted with them. It’s a great influence to me
to have insight into people’s stories and visions.

Like you, I’ll share my story and vision. It’s political in nature. So I’m not here to sell something
in an email list, I’m happy enough with the connection already created. I think that’s why I find it
important to DM people, email people or see people directly rather than to hide behind some
kind of wall of influence. I look up to leaders that do that and I hope that if I were to ever “make it
big” one day, I would have the muscle to do something like that daily. I really believe in the
exponential impacts of individual interactions and I believe in the consequences of being or
feeling seen.

I don’t necessarily want to be a politician in the way that we recognize. I’m not too concerned
with popularity. I want to write policy. That’s why it would inevitably place me in some political
context.

It’s why I chose to study computer science. At its foundation it’s the science of computation or
the science of solving problems. You use things like algorithms but what’s not often discussed
publicly in the policy layer of technological operating systems. That is the code that governs the
rules for machine learning tools, financial technology networks or any number of information
technologies that regulate their ability to service.

I think in light of the trials with the US government and Tiktok CEO, many young voters can
recognize that a lot of the political arena of the future will be difficult conversations around
technological policies interoperating with our day-to-day. It can be both terribly boring and
awfully important. I think we can recognize that even digital natives are not prepared for the
level of social complexity and consequence behind these kinds of things.

It’s why I tend to connect a lot of things - education, engineering, media and so on. For folks that
connect with me around the internet, you may notice that I can get rather encyclopedic about
things sometimes. That’s kinda why. I wanted to find myself in compelling situations where I
could direct the right policies related to technology and education. That's a pretty broad and
demanding thing.

It was something that I decided many years ago. Needless to say, the pandemic was a bit of a
period of enlightenment for me. It was one of those things we all experience at times where our
crazy ideas end up being not-so-crazy after all. I am a strong believer in limiting the influence
and capacity of technological operations in education and I highlight the belief in one simple
phrase - if the technology does not disrupt, it interrupts. There is an important function in
computer operating systems known as interruptions. Policies should be extremely mindful of
where these interruptions occur and how they ought to be configured.

Like I wrote in the original “A Letter To You”, education is inevitably complicated for individuals
and the social fabric they find themselves in. There is no way around it. However, this is not a
letter to address those personal complexities. I see the drug war as the greatest problem in The
United States. It produces risks and consequences that we should think of often. We could
examine the situation as critically as scholars, as skeptical as scientists or as concerned as
vulnerable citizens but I feel it would be a better practice to exercise common sense, reject
denial and observe the obvious. This is why I choose to go in the direction of education policy. It
is a challenging economic problem that I find purpose in.

I believe that amending the drug war would result in improved social attitudes for our borders,
communities, business networks and families. Then and only then will we be able to heal from
the genocides of the past and the slavery that ensued, creating centuries to erode trust for
minority neighbors. Until then the ceiling is a fiction and delusion for safety. There is no real
home or community. Until then there will always be an economic force of nature, no different
than the unstoppable forces of gravity or density, that will define the set of possibilities for our
reality.

It is a hard pill to swallow but not a message of discouragement. It is one of purpose. This
situation in some way or another led you to writing to me and me writing to you - and although
you and I may be safe today, that was not the case for someone like Adam Toledo, Laquan
McDonald or Elijah McClain.

Why do I find the drug war so compelling? It’s a matter of our participation in a brutal and
ruthless legacy for international control. I’m not here to critically review the morality of agents of
our history and the consequences of their campaigns. I just can’t help but feel that this distrust
in our neighbors today is unreasonable. The reality is that the political arena we find ourselves
in is ruthless, rapid and quick to destroy any threat in the way of its conquest. “Winning” this
conversation, which may seem as common sense to some, is to surrender and question the
legacy of conquest and control. It is like Vladimir Putin achieving international reconsideration of
NATO or America reconsidering Civil Rights or the Civil War. The odds are not in our favor.

We don’t need to distrust nations like Mexico, El Salvador or Colombia. Most of the drug trade is
a simple matter of agricultural supply and demand. How ridiculous isn’t it! From a political point
of view, we don’t even need to stretch as far as campaigning on the legalization of cocaine and
the social challenge and threat that it comes with. We would simply need to allow access to
coca leaves.

People that purchase coca leaves are likely to experiment with creating cocaine or some
consumer alternative and this is a simple economic outcome for opportunity that is no different
than sale of cold brew coffee, live resin cannabis or some other consumer preference. How
often are you going as far as baking your own cannabis edibles? People prefer service over
work. Our entire economy booms from this incentive.

It’s all important to understand. Some of it seems obvious. Some of it is certainly nonsensical.
Some of it is not intuitive. There’s also a lot of complexity worth reflecting on. Would
commoditizing coca leaves result in a degraded market for fentanyl and opium distribution?
Would relaxed attitudes on a drugs culturally allow others to approach the problem differently?
Would this have consequences on social health care systems or our understanding of personal
responsibility?

That’s why I’m here. That’s why I’m doing what I’m doing. Along the journey I view myself as
some kind of representative in service of that problem. Along the way I learn important things
and I curate it in some way or another wondering what impact could I have along the way.
That’s how I managed to create this system called Robots Building Education and how I got it to
wire in a way where my network creates scholarships out of their learning and participation.
That’s I’m not too worried about capital, competition or that whole set of considerations even
though it is seriously important.You can call it a community. Someone can call it a bank or a
business. Someone else might call it tutoring. RO.B.E for me is a key component for the kind of
servant I want to be in the future.

In the original Letter, I had written that purpose can be defined by spending meaningful time
alone with one’s beliefs, abandoning fear or doubt and having the courage to elect some kind of
problem to solve or participation in a problem. That’s what the drug war is for me. I would like for
it to conclude in my lifetime. There would be hard work to do after it, but at least that work would
come with a certain peace of mind.

So thank you for taking the time to apply for the scholarship! I’m still getting the hang of doing
this, but I cherish the ability to connect and write back. If you do want to participate more in
Robots Building Education, I have a Patreon where subscribers often vote on to define policies
for Robots Building Education and allows it to survive and grow. The software these days in the
app has improved a considerable amount, but this Patreon existed at one point with subscribers
who got access to nothing but an idea, so you’re encouraged to join in on the journey and
hopefully I can create software and content that can help you catch up academically, excel
economically or find itself embedded in some public manner

See you around!

Sheilfer
