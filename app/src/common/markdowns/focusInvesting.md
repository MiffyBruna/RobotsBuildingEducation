# Focused Investing

Investing in stocks is ultimately a science in making decisions. Focused investing is the practice I follow - so the most I can ultimately do for you here is provide you with timeless wisdom and examples of the practice so that you can start off on the right foot. So let's jump right into it.

### 1. Diversification is protection against ignorance.

Focused investing is the opposite of diversification. You should still start diversified. In general, the less aware you are, the more you should diversify. Protection against ignorance is an extremely powerful thing and you ought to get in the habit of realizing that you will always know very little relative to the ebbs and flows of information that exist.

Most people simply don't have the time to pour of books and readings, so they allow financial advisors to manage their funds via 401k retirement accounts or various highly regarded indexes and ETFs like the S&P500. These investments are essentially large bundles that are tied to the overall market performance.

**It's extremely important to start here.** It's the best starting position because you're more or less investing in an advanced algorithm that's selecting for the best possible average. That's a great deal for most people. If all your investments end up being diversified ones, that's fine. That's still focused investing if you make that informed decision.

But what's the next phase after that? Well, let's say you're extremely interested in investing in "green energy markets" or "cybersecurity markets". There are ETFs for that - so start there. But as you can see, you narrowed down an entire level with this practice already.

To summarize, you need to more or less understand the nature of numbers to appreciate diversification and it's complement, focused investing. Focused investing provides more volatility, but it's crucial to remember that volatility is not risk. Diversification is a reduction of volatility. In short, don't drive fast until you're a trained driver.

### 2. The more that you read, the more successful you will be.

At the end of the day, you're going to be reading encyclopedias of information as you build a network of knowledge of the moving pieces that exist within companies and the relationship they have to the market. This isn't to promote endless analysis before making a choice, although it may come to that like it did for me, but to promote exploration of ideas that you have.

You will inevitably read through numerous public market filings, annual reports and quarterly reports. You're going to inevitably start mapping out all of the numbers that govern the performance of a business. You will know when you've read enough about a company or market because your imagination and the creativity of your questions will simply plummet.

### 3. Control your bias

The single biggest problem you will have on this journey is controlling for bias. Bias in an extremely powerful and invisible force that governs our ability to make decisions. It's sneaky too - for example, someone may read the last wisdom and decide to read a book about Steve Jobs only to confirm their already existing bias about Apple and drive them toward investment. You need to be extremely careful here because this is pretty much the ultimate challenge you'll face as an investor.

One of the biggest challenges here is understanding what you think you know vs. what you really know. If you're following me closley along, you'll start to make connections between protecting yourself from ignorance, reading a lot and controlling your understanding. It's a pretty good recipe for success if you ask me!

As always, I recommend listening to the Harvard Lecture by Charlie Munger called "The Psychology Of Human Misjudgement". I would argue it's one of the greatest lectures in history.

### 4. Understand incentives

Understanding incentives is the next most difficult challenge behind picking stocks. You need to understand why people do things. That is tricky and disappointing process and it as complicated as advanced multivariable calculus. But once you have a solid grasp of that, you know why organizations like Pinterest can exist happily along organizations like Instagram and Amazon.

Another key knowledge point here is understanding that changing the incentive changes the behavior. We as a species are simply hard-wired to adapt and take-risks, so changing the reason why people do that will help you understand why businesses are choosing to work on particular things.

This isn't simply a macro-level observation. For example, you wouldn't make inform decision because "electric vehicles are the future and people won't want to pay for gas". Although that's true, it's not particularly compelling. Understanding incentives will have you understand seemingly unreasonable market standards like American's unwillingness to exchange their iPhone devices. Understanding a company's incentives will ultimately have you understand whether or not you're in a safe place to invest money.

### 5. Study the greats

Similar to wisdom 2, you ought to pick the right role models and influences. This is true for anything, but particularly true for the stock market. As a general rule of thumb, the closer you are to money, the more value that trust has. So don't simply pick popular models, pick ones that worked hard to earn your trust.

I recommend to start with Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet, Jack Bogle and Cathie Wood. They are all exceptional figures in their own way that have greatly influenced many investors across time. They will provide other insights to consider. You may discover your own over time, but most would agree that there is meaningful information to be learned from these folks.

You could try not to study the greats and figure it out on your own. You may even get lucky too, but what you're ultimately doing is practicing the art of walking into an arena to get slaughtered by a lion. It's not a very reasonable decision.

### Conclusion I

So to keep the practice going, I'm going to keep it to 5 simple points. It may take you years to process fully the depth here and they're really omnipresent pieces of wisdom that will help you as an investor or entrepeneur alike. I can continue on and on about other things, but investing in the stock market is ultimately an identity problem. You are different than me, and so is your temperament and risk-taking clock.

Like coding, the point isn't about just writing software - there's a bigger conversation here about how and why you invest in things that aren't stocks. These are your relationships, where you live, what you practice and any number of other time commitments that you make. If I had to offer one last piece of wisdom - fight like living hell to secure your right to health, time and space before money. Sometimes life has you focusing on money but keep your vision clear - you don't want to learn the hard way why health and time is more important. It'll keep you humble and honest.

So let's dive in shall we? What do I invest in and why?

# The Portfolio

In the spirit of the tradition, we're going to briefly cover my investments. In the future, there may be a better time and place to dive into all of these concepts more closely but for now, this should all take quite some time to really internalize. Before starting I want the reader to illustrate to remember an idea. Investing your money as an adult is essentially the equivalent of a child learning how to swim. Any fool can examine a deep body of water and understand that their is some inherent risk in trying to learn how to swim but the task is ultimately not that big of a deal. The same goes for investing. You typically just need some experience and guidance. I think a lot of people like to believe that investing is like jumping into a sea filled with sharks. It can be that if you want it to be but it's obviously a nonsensical thing to do to put yourself in that kind of situation. In fact, you could give someone like me $500,000,000 and I would likely be able to allocate that money and sleep soundly at night knowing that the market isn't going to suddenly vanquish any of it.

One of the wisdoms I follow, not listed above, is one provided by Munger and Buffet. They suggest not to directly invest in things outside of your circle of competence.
This piece of wisdom took me a while to understand, which lead me to the advice I provided earlier about really taking the time to understand what you know vs. what you think you know.

So I invest in social media, financial technology and education technology. I believe those industries have non-trivial growth trajectories ahead of them and I believe that I can understand these investments better than the typical investor. Despite having a background in computer science, I don't expand into seemingly common sense investments like semiconductor chips or AI - but that simply points to the practice of investing in what you truly know. I don't truly spend too much time working on AI or pouring over modern advancements so I don't extend myself in those directions!

When it comes to these industries, I generally invest in assets that are offered at fair or good prices. This is another wisdom not listed about investing in wonderful companies at fair prices, rather than fair companies at wonderful prices. But what is wonderful? In my opinion, it's some combination of having deep market penetration, a profoundly good reputation and excellent product marketing.

These are great American companies like Costco, Apple, Disney and the sort. We may recognize the value of the brands, but why is it that we recognize these brands so much?
So when it comes to applying these concepts, I've ultimately boiled it down to primarily 5 investments. And if you're wondering, yes I've done deep reading on every company, their financials, their history, their leaders and the overarching stories:

1. Pinterest
2. Block
3. Duolingo
4. Berkshire Hathaway
5. Apple

# Pinterest & Social Media

## Understanding incentives

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/fea67ddd-516d-402e-b4ea-b2032363c650">

Understanding incentives is a subject you’ll need to question and learn in order to understand and pick apart businesses. Incentives are drivers for economic behavior.

Pinterest is a company I like to use to understand incentives. Immediately, many novice investors may ask questions like, “Why would you invest in Pinterest when Tiktok or Meta exists?” and I like to answer this question by asking, “What drives you to shop at Target or Costco?”. It’s there where we can start to look at different concepts like psychological bias and other economic consequences that drive our consumer behavior. So let’s ask the question, why do we use Pinterest when Meta or Tiktok exists?

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/2d0ae050-0ffe-4b55-8249-b828df1f2156">

## The Mental Model

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/1fa18dcb-f66e-422f-a267-16453744ba41">

Let’s start with a simple mental model to understand where we are on the internet. Social networks are a subset of communication technologies and these communication platforms create a network known as the internet. Communication platforms tend to range from intention to entertainment. This spectrum isn’t linear, sometimes entertainment platforms can be intentional. Sometimes tools can be entertaining. I want us to think really abstractly about what communication even means. It’s the source of a lot of change and movement.

For example, a singer like Beyoncé can clearly sing for our entertainment, but what happens if a singer is suddenly protesting some social issue? Suddenly this entertainer becomes intentful in her communications. So platforms aren’t always one-dimensional, but a lot of these platforms are going to be driven by the data that informs it. This is what we know as the algorithm. For that reason, platforms like Instagram and Pinterest tend to have more curation in their distribution while platforms like Tiktok or Snapchat may be more candid or “lo-fi” in their approach. We can ponder why that is and you’ll come up with various potential answers.

So this is why we use different social platforms. They fulfill the needs of their customers for different reasons and they have genuine moats around those services. This is why Google, despite its size and influence, were unable to compete with the social nature of Facebook, a platform designed around connection. This may also explain why Pinterest can still perform impressively well despite sharing space with platforms like Tiktok, Google, Instagram or even Amazon.

## Data & Design

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/16deabf2-3576-438d-b828-f30d6c637385">

But how? How did Pinterest accomplish a moat? Let’s start with how the data originated. In its early days, Pinterest was a platform where content was shared, collected and curated by its users. These pins fulfilled some private and organizational needs for the users. They were popular vision boards. Plans. Over time, this need transformed into a visual search engine. This search engine became recognized as a search engine for ideas. It was at this point where Pinterest really started to grow its word-of-mouth reputation as a useful utility for people’s homes.

And now, we are in the era where this platform transforms yet again, especially with the advent of creative media - where the platform seeks to transform itself into a shopping platform. So Pinterest, from the perspective of its customers, lets them discover ideas, plan and execute those ideas.

And you might be thinking, well, doesn’t a platform like Amazon do that? And the answer is yes, which is why I see a platform like Pinteres closer to competing with organizations like Google & Amazon rather than entertainment platforms like Meta and Tiktok. Pinterest is geared toward intentional communication.

## Macroeconomics

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/c57a740c-e42a-44bd-a14d-d9819949ec27">

There’s a lot of potential and promise behind Pinterest’s current market value. Another moat-building outcome is that the platform is overwhelmingly used by women, such that expansion to any country almost guarantees that nearly 50% adoption of the adult population are monthly active users.

The only real plausible explanation for this is that Pinterest is a platform that delivers on the promise of its design and users develop a high form of trust with the platform. What this means is that the value-per-pixel in its advertising space is higher than the average of other advertising spaces; Pinterest is a platform designed around high-quality outcomes. In summary, Pinterest is a kind of business that can accomplish something once per month rather than depending on a model that depends on daily usage. It's a trade-off in the advertising world.

In recent history, this theory was back tested and strongly signaled by potential acquisitions from Microsoft and Paypal for upwards 45 billion dollars. The final outcome seemingly appeared that Paypal’s COO, formerly Venmo CEO, became the new CEO of Pinterest, while the founder moved into the role of executive chairman of the board while researching the future psychological-health technology. These are significant movements toward monetization.

What you may notice here with Pinterest is that the story tends to just make sense. It is my belief that Pinterest remains a strong acquisition for organizations like Target or Amazon since this platform may transform into a disruptive competitor - how?

## The Future

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/91ca663e-6e34-40ae-b9a3-a44f4600f134">

Many investors have the habit of avoiding good opportunities or overcomplicating potential opportunities when new-fangled technology arrives to the markets. One such case is the uncertain strategies surrounding AI investments. Pinterest is one such investment. Given the nature of the platform and its history, it’s clear that Pinterest has a very real possibility of competing with global organizations like SHEIN, Tiktok Shop and other AI-powered shopping channels.

This is one of the reasons I liken Pinterest to the business of Costco. Customers tend to enter and leave the platform happily. They follow an internal philosophy to achieve quality selection. The distribution is also intentional and meaningful. A quick browse just now has briefly introduced ads about Visa, Southwest Airlines and Expedia. A search for kitchen ideas presents an entire browsing section aligned with Amazon ads.

Now the truth is, every business is going to experience some level of churn. We hear complaints from customers about the “old version” of services and it's a very real problem that businesses need to solve. You could survey 1000 American Tik Tok users at the beginning of the launch of Tik Tok Shops and a year later and see various different outcomes and attitudes.

It is my view that Pinterest will find good ways to manage that problem and users will adapt to the changes around advertising, shopping and marketing. I think a healthy outcome would be if this combination encouraged more people to post organically, spurring the creation of successful creator businesses and an alternative yet focused service that stays away from the chaos of other social platforms.

## Conclusion

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/35080d40-fe49-4a78-83b2-9e3c79442649">

In short, there’s a lot of potential and promise behind Pinterest’s current market value and the total addressable market surrounding retail, advertising and payments. The history and path ahead appears well-poised for success. Its current valuation appears to reflect that of a wonderful company at a fair price. The position of the business is fundamentally sound and simple to understand. The moat it maintains relative to its titan-sized competitors is visible. I believe it’s a strong acquisition target if not a company that successfully multiplies its growth and presence as a reliable American brand. Pinterest can be a reasonable way to invest in social media, similar to buying a nice piece of real estate in the internet society. Either way, it's a good starting point to learn more about the investing in the industry.

# Block & Financial Technology

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/c649c73f-ca8f-4f52-80ff-950b41a9bf72">

Block is an organization that is responsible for Square, Cash App, TIDAL, TBD and Spiral. Its primarily a financial services company that provides solutions for consumers and small businesses. It also supports larger businesses, as its intention is to help smaller operations grow. They invest their money into Bitcoin research and develop software for it.

## My History With Bitcoin

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/fe2c8f13-5330-445c-a86c-009ccdec7a1d">
 
The year was 2015 in Chicago and I was a computer science student in an operating systems course. I was working  in a screw manufacturer with machines and robotics. My friend had come over to consume some cannabis and we began a regular conversation over graphics cards available in the market.

We had this conversation because it would often be the case that I was gaming online with old computer hardware and this would limit my experiences. This time was a little different. AMD had released some modern cards at an affordable price. We talked about how gaming was getting ubiquitous worldwide and how it made sense to improve access. Little did we know that we would see these products experience regular shortages in the future.

This conversation would last for many years. We learned that you could do this process called mining to acquire these Ethereum tokens. We explored business ideas around these kinds of things. I didn’t really need to be convinced of the value of digital currency at the time. It had been 10 years of understanding that you can convert your real world money into digital tokens to purchase premium products with online games.

Blockchain-based currency was different since these gaming transactions were often one-way transactions. Once I converted my money into game currency, it was almost impossible to convert it back. This invented an illicit market of “gold farmers” in many online video games, which were exchange brokers that broke the rules of the game in order to sell gaming currency for real dollars. A similar reality was true for many artists who suddenly lost revenue due to peer-to-peer sharing on unregulated networks.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/59ae8877-7963-44c8-90d4-855f2e927abb">

However, this required an unaccountable relationship of trust and security. It lead to problems for a number of industries and it was against the policies and regulations that businesses had to follow to prevent crime when operating card networks. There were many interesting economic realities that online video games and peer-networks produced, but it was clear that there were some limitations as a result of how early these institutions were to internet software. Keep in mind that these gold farming markets were in 2005! We didn’t really have a cohesive understanding with collaborating online. Most folks didn’t spend much time online.

What had convinced me to adopt a long-term view was the understanding that the network depended on a collection of miners that had a strong relationship with energy and heat. I thought it was a beautifully done process. It was clear to me that there was a future where these machines would upgrade or transform. Needless to say, I found the Proof-of-Work approach fascinating in its potential, but it was also easy to view a lot of technology that way. We really didn't know what was going to happen.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/a938a369-2e42-4057-a3a3-1293dc477740">
 
One has to remember that I’m an individual that essentially aged alongside the commercial internet and folks like us are eager and driven to see changes in a number of sectors. We are hopeful for the future and the outcomes created by these solutions. Bitcoin is something that sits brightly between intersections of energy policy, robotics, social networks or even cannabis policy.

That was all for some time. That was my introduction to the markets. Being a gamer and a computer science student gave me an edge in the consumer tech market. I was still this individual without much to work with so my best move was to watch and learn. Bitcoin and its associated markets were still very volatile and it wasn’t really a winning bet for me at the time regardless of what transpired in the markets. I didn’t know enough. I did know that it would be unwise to discount or discredit the invention. I still had time.

I graduated from college some years later and moved to the Bay Area. I ended up working at a financial technology startup. This exposed me to the regulatory environment around banking and financial networks. My manager was also quite a believer in Bitcoin. He talked about it in relation to the principles of investing. It was a good place for me to learn things about money.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/aec16447-d377-43fa-a17e-e4bc0c437c18">

This period of my life became a peculiar intersection of events. I became a pretty battle-hardened software engineer that adapted quickly to the changes brought by the COVID lockdowns. Digital collaboration wasn’t a foreign concept for me or many folks my age. It was quietly preferred for many of us. It was crucial to the success of the economy in some ways.

I became a writer on the side and started what was going to be my career as a creator. I wrote about the optimistic future of technology and the organizations that will drive us in that direction. I worked on my business. I began to understand social media, its constraints and gateways in ways I was unfamiliar with. I also began to learn a lot about the art of investing in a serious way. It was apparent that my advantage was in the tech market but I was not skilled enough yet to make big choices. It would ultimately narrow down to social media, financial and education technology investments.

## The Product

This all happened before and after the events that transpired with Bitcoin in 2020. It wasn’t really until closer to the year 2021 when I turned my head toward Bitcoin after the company Square had acquired TIDAL and placed Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter to the board.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/b714b51a-b9b1-482b-a696-b17783198601">

It wasn’t until 2022 that I began to appreciate the potential of Bitcoin’s future after taking some time to understand a white-paper written by Block and its approach to decentralizing networks with the company they created called TBD. That was the mysterious software ecosystem that many folks like me patiently awaited for. There wasn’t as much time anymore.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/e4ac87c8-b3d9-4da3-972d-1f15cf8653b7">

And it was in 2023 where we arrive today with the advent of generative AI and recommended social feeds. At this point, it’s pretty clear for anyone that is following what we are going to see. We’re going to see competition between networks. We’ve been seeing it.

To those that like a good prediction, it’s likely that we will see the ability to transact between applications like Cash App and Coinbase. It would become a process no different than a Gmail sender being able to deliver a message to Yahoo Mail recipients.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/4f0e4af0-f2f8-4456-9dd9-bca891c5e306">

The same is built for social media. There are early signs that these mechanisms work after Instagram’s successful launch and onboarding for Threads. It’s in the best interest of the user to have these networks decentralized in a way where people are the owners of the publications and relationships rather than the platforms - since the platforms do not provide you those things - they are earned and created by people interacting. There is a non-trivial need for this, since there are a growing amount of people that depend on these communication technologies for their income.

And Block is at the center of this. It wants to be a good steward of the internet and its financial networks are a gateway to achieve that. Bitcoin, at the end of the day, may be a system that most consumers aren’t interfacing with, the same way most people aren't all too concerned with the details for treasury bills when exchanging in the value of a dollar. The same could be said for sending emails. Users aren’t really concerned with the protocols underneath it that transmit the data, they’re interested in the service.

That’s the foundation of financial services. You need to create incentives to entrust, transact or deposit money. Block is unique in how they’re seen as an innovative company, yet they operate in a rather simple and pragmatic manner for their day-to-day. There isn't too much risk associated with their clientele. Block is the kind of company that works when a merchant has a cardboard sign with a $cashtag address written on it. There aren’t many shiny objects.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/69e48b26-e2b0-48dc-b00b-4239d0b5d70a">

I believe that’s what Jack, the founder of Block and Twitter, means by Bitcoin being the native currency of the internet. There will be new services and ways to interface with applications without the same limitations created by centralized services, banks and card networks. These unlocks can become liberating mechanisms for consumers and merchants.

## The Social

The United States had recently exited the world war as a global power and went through an era of reforming global geopolitics under its influence. A lot of recent American history can be understood under that context. Oversimplifying, there were two global powers after the world war and they had competing economic policies. One can assume that the greater system would likely result in the greater or more productive military over a period of time. There’s a number of ways to opine or produce a narrative around history. Either way, the American military was more influential. Society changed in unique ways.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/838a2873-9644-4bd4-84a0-0e21b1127de8">
 
This influence relationship applied domestically and internationally. It was a time of expressing power over supply chains. In the US, it meant containment through drug war. It also suggested a reworking of monetary standards away from gold and toward dollar-based trust. These implementations were almost immediately after the Civil Rights Act, invoking a new era of control.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/743756b6-0fb2-4af4-9a93-5bda50d09e2b">

By this time, designing powerful communication networks was no longer unknown. It was rapidly applied to the financial pipelines. It was policies written in the Bank Secrecy Act that governed these transactions and thus began a long legacy of controls and monitors in the name of preventing crime. It created a network to determine and score trust amongst civilians, criminals, terrorists and enemies of state. This continues today with sophisticated algorithms to handle the level of scale these operations have become.

And at this point it really isn’t much of a debate to see the consequences of these policies. Academics in humanities will typically accept the common sense premise that racism and expressions of power didn’t suddenly vanquish due to the outcomes brought by Martin Luther King and the success of the Civil Rights movement. Economics is not a simple linear progression. We can see the outcomes of Black American families that were effectively subjugated economically by these policies. It can also be similarly witnessed in the suppression of Latin American economies.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/9159437e-e8ef-4e54-8ffc-66f2d1ae8563">

This model ultimately backtracks to before the Civil Rights and after the Patriot Act . Our new financial standards created a system dependent on trust. The more trusted you were by the owners of the networks and reserves, the more access you had to capital systems. The longer you’ve participated in these networks, the more likely you’ve gathered trust. These underfunded schools, unbanked societies and our attitudes toward civil development are informed by this reality and what it incentivizes. One could eventually draw the connection that the system that produced the inequity was the same one that allowed culture to express their experiences in it through now-American staples like rap and hip-hop.

But obviously, people are largely unconcerned with committing crimes with these kinds of transactions. This creates a disconnection. Using cash gives you privacy but technology and networks do not. Cash doesn’t require verification, but cards do. Cards are convenient despite this, but it’s clear that the medium of exchange is transforming. The next stage seems to be the legitimization of cards as money, and this is why Bitcoin is often referred to as true digital cash.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/07bd8202-1b0f-4da5-b98e-3a65f0068daa">

Increasing the privacy of digital transactions would thus facilitate interactions we have yet to really experience online. Our current pipelines do not allow this to happen. This is what is known as trustless interactions. The system leaves trust up to its users. Again, the user often does not see what happens or upgrades behind the scenes, but our current pipelines also do not allow for service to be built - so what happens in the background is important.

This reality is what defines the vision and culture behind Block. It can create new pipelines. What drives the organization is building solutions that solve problems related to financial access and inclusion. The company can’t be understood otherwise. Its attitude toward financial services is different from other vendors. As such, it’s important to value the principles of diversity, access and history when accounting for the direction Block will take. One needs to appreciate the outcomes of working in the economics of oppression.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/bbc4dcb7-d9c9-4e00-9a2c-0bca4aa0ab95">

As a result, Block ties itself to the legacy and struggle that Black Americans and other minority groups experience, and this can be observed at all levels of the organization. Block is not your traditional Silicon Valley dream - its products are grounded by reality and the needs of main street. These seemingly random events, like the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador, are especially relative and share a common economic story.

There is this accessibility principle that I teach about how creating access for those who need it creates access for those who didn’t ask for it. I often provide the example that designing information to be read clearly by a screen reader may benefit those who read the same information since it’s well organized. I relate it to the advent of radio and podcast and how new mediums may change the experiences we participate in or appreciate. The same could be said for restrictive or liberating laws, policies and social codes.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/3023c021-c7c6-4662-88c3-b1275dbf9c3a">

Block, in many ways, positions itself by providing solutions to alleviate the cost of poverty by developing sound solutions inspired by Bitcoin and financial services for local economies. As a result, what you saw was Cash App popularized originally in spaces where oppression economics are highest in the United States, which would be impoverished inner cities in the southern US. It was accepted and embedded into cultures that inform and influence what we recognize as “Gen Z” or younger digitally native culture.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/27466d6d-8f27-4b91-804e-acf81e761eb6">

This outcome isn’t some kind of master plan devised by someone. It’s the outcome of the simple reality that the organization started by selling hardware to accept and bridge payment cards through internet connected phones. To accept cash with technology. In some ways, developing Bitcoin software is also a revolution of the company itself, where they’re repeating the same steps they took when they started building bridges. In short, the company started solving a financial access problem and continued to expand from that founding principle. The intersection is an act of nature.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/26b8d7d3-bbba-4b5a-a994-df73fa0bc5ea">

Block capturing this market position and social reputation is nothing short of a phenomenon. It’s one that many companies don’t have the privilege of achieving. Its creative positioning is exactly what allows it to be a disruptive force over the long term. This positioning is not all too different from the gateways that Apple accessed with the iPod and its transformation into the iPhone.

And thus I believe that Block’s acquisition of TIDAL and their partnership with Shawn Carter is a historic one. It’s a unique relationship between visionaries across technical and social landscapes that can’t be replicated by other financial institutions. It’s an act of legacy and an act to actualize historic outcomes for the betterment of society. You could argue that investing in TIDAL with current conditions would be like investing in the value of hip-hop.

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/41ba44e1-9437-4b5a-8c48-4a7bbd249958">

I believe the typical wall street analyst undervalues the potential generated by this relationship and thus misses the point or even the purpose that drives Block’s underlying growth. Block wants to repair old economies and introduce new ones and it wants to do it from an approach that creates fairness and equilibrium. It wants to change the game.

## The Future

Block is a predictable business. They want to right financial wrongs. It, like many of their peers, wants to improve the internet. In the short term, you’ll see it enter nascent but influential local markets like cannabis or beauty. You’ll see them facilitate small but accessible loans or meaningful alternatives. Their advertisements will be popular, impactful and welcomed. You’ll find them from local restaurants all the way up to arena conacerts.

In the long term, you’ll see them continue to apply the same financial inclusion model to continue to grow. You really have to ask what the point is at a certain level. What does it mean in the world if Block is a 300 billion dollar company that competes with organizations like Chase or Visa? Why would that outcome occur?

<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/5584cf1d-30cc-41bc-ae03-38d5c4635c3a">

In my view, the same financial inclusion pattern would apply at scale. They may foray into larger trust applications and solve problems related to housing or even government scale enterprise. It may be an organization as influential as Universal Music Group or other art & entertainment networks. It may capture or invent markets we are not yet aware of.

Regardless, we know that the fundamentals of banking and financial services is financial stewardship. These institutions must be trusted to upkeep the financial pipelines that fuel economic activity. Block is ultimately a platform to help its customers secure wealth. It doesn’t seem all too driven by financial gains when it seeks to innovate. The organization, from its leadership down to its marketing, seems to be focused on the creation of fair playing fields, so it invokes a sense of trust for the future.

## Conclusion

In short, Block is an organization that unlocks new networks and focuses on securing wealth for its customers by creating useful tools and opportunities. It has a unique reputation in the market and a strong relationship with their customers. It is eager to use the trust they’ve cultivated to introduce new ideas that challenge older ways of transacting data or money across networks. For how epic the vision is, the organization takes an awfully modest approach to business-as-usual by being fairly pragmatic with innovation. The leadership and culture is visionary so it is not distracted by the shiny objects along the way. Block is a company that’s focused on building well-oiled pipelines that can play a key part in the future of US economics.

### Understanding Duolingo & Education Technology

Education technology is one of those things that baffles technologists because it's seemingly impossible to disrupt the classroom. This is something I've dedicated a lot of time to understand and I started the journey with a pretty simple concept - education is centered around a student's experience.

It's difficult to change the classroom because the classroom is a collection of individuals with random relationship dynamics informed by their surroundings. So developing technology for the classroom often falls short of expectations and it isn't a very intuitive thing to understand. This is why, despite several technological revolutions, the classroom remains awfully resilient to change. Simply put, the delivery content is not enough for technology to improve outcomes systemically.
It's important to remember the foundation of this subject - education is centered around a students experience. We tend to segment the conversation into different branches, which are pretty much varying levels of constraints introduced to a student or their classrooms. But education is far more economic than that and is tied closer to the limited experience we have as people. Consider, for example, the market crash invoked by the COVID pandemic - such an experience incentivized people around the world to learn about the stock market. Consider the existential crisis that many students encounter "choosing" a study in their college careers.

Duolingo may be a company is capable of achieving that extraordinary outcome. To illustrate the impact we're talking about, this organization is positioned to provide literacy solutions for global audiences wanting to learn English or any other dominant business language. It has compelling market conditions worth observing beyond an American perspective of the value of language learning.

The organization created an ever-improving game representing a learning journey that allowed it to penetrate the consumer market internationally, which is a rare achievement for a formal education technology company. This affords it a profoundly long roadmap. This really places the company close to the first mile of learning in general, since speech is one of the first skills we acquire in our life journey.

The big risk with this approach is that it just about requires consumer level adoption in order for it to survive as a publicly traded company. One of my early attitudes in education technology development was to avoid the temptation to depend on gamification. I held a conservative attitude after watching audiences ebb and flow between popular online video games and I determined that most education technology companies were developing pretty bad games. Duolingo likely understood this and delivered a modest approach centered around retention and practice.

The company operates in a much broader manner than other paid services that try to solve more local problems, like homework helping platforms. The freemium model placed them in a unique position as an effective edutainment company. It became a meme. This allowed it to take a chaotic but productive direction with popular culture and public consciousness.

<br/>

So to summarize, it has a compelling business case and has achieved extraordinary market positioning that no education technology has really achieved. It took an enormous risk in its approach, an approach that takes a significant amount of time to get right, and appears to be executing on the approach correctly. It has a moat.

This focus on literacy has second-order effects that seal the deal for me. It added recent services to teach the foundations of music and mathematics. This is a strong signal that they have a repeatable recipe for success to multiply the growth of their business. These subjects also push Duolingo further into PC markets since things like math and music are popular demands for elementary and high school classrooms devices. This push makes it more likely that Duolingo can expand to other mediums and forms for other subjects like coding, history or any other learning enrichment.

On top of this, Duolingo is a lean startup. It was run by 95 people by the time it approached 1 billion in worth. Today it has roughly 600 employees. This is a signal that they are effective at allocating capital and utilizing resources. It's the kind of environment that would use ChatGPT to improve their company before improving their product. For the most part, the numbers check out.

Duolingo is an expensive stock as of September 2023. From an investor point of view, the market is charging a significant premium for two primary reasons. Duolingo carries positive sentiment with OpenAI's influence over the tech industry. It's also growing rapidly. The market is essentially confident that the company will continue rapid growth and its current expensive pricing is a temporary placeholder to capture it. At current rates, we'll see Duolingo operating 1 billion in revenue in the next 2 to 3 years. This places current investors in a risky situation where investors need to determine whether the opportunity cost is worth it.

Growth stocks are tricky because the ultimate goal is to effectively capture the market. At times people will express confusion by organizations like Tesla being valued at seemingly absurd levels, but that's because the market is pricing in confidence that and industry will be captured. It's at that point that the organization has to maintain confidence in order to not crash, and part of that is achieved through the numbers. In Tesla's case, it retained dominance, while it did not in Zoom's case.

In my view, it's a difficult thing to execute on. I'm currently focused on burn rate for the growth of Robots Building Education, so I'm experiencing some level of additional restraint and fiscal conservatism. It is difficult to justify paying a premium today but can also see the argument that the current rate of growth would change the conversation where current prices are cheap. So the stock is currently at the top of the watchlist. Appropriate valuation would cement it at the level that Block and Pinterest, which carries a "buy as much as you can and try to sell as little as humanely possible over time" sentiment. For now, the decision is complex and based on your own risk assessment and bias, but I am eager to add it to the "RO.B.E Portfolio"

education technology is with one simple statement; what else is education other than a student's experience?

### Understanding Finance & Berkshire Hathaway

https://profitviz.com/BRK-A

Berkshire hathaway is somewhat complex to understand. It is one of the "incumbents" or market leadrs. These investments are at times necessary when seeking to diversify or counterbalance risk. It's an enormous decentralized network of unrelated businesses ranging from Dairy Queen to GEICO insurance that fuels investments into individual stocks. In a nutshell, investing in Berkshire is like investing in the industrial production of compounding returns.

It's pretty fascinating because despite the business model of having aggressive invesments like a 40% holding in Apple, most investors would consider Berkshire to be a financially conservative institution and many prefer to invest in Berkshire instead of the overall market. This is Berkshire investors are confident that their money is being used wisely rather than optimally. So the point of investing in Berkshire isn't particularly for its growth opportunity.

Understanding that base then lets your understand how Berkshire approaches money. It generally invests in heavy cash and inelastic generating businesses like insurance, railroads and energy. They then grab this cash and essentially invest it to take stake into stocks or securities in the market. These stocks tend to follow a simple model, where Berkshire will generally invest in extremely high reputation organizations like Apple, Coca Cola, Heinz-Kraft or Bank of America.

Hopefully at this point you start to consider that intelligence isn't really what you want in the market, it's wisdom. You don't want to select for the smartest investment. You want to select for the most common sense one. The answer you're looking for tends to be in front of you for a reason.

### Understanding Apple & Technology

https://profitviz.com/AAPL

It's pretty simple to describe Apple. Apple is another of the epic incumbents. The way I like to describe apple is "industrial mastery". If you consider the lifetime value of family spend on Apple devices are services, one could argue that individuals spend as much on Apple products than they do closing a deal on the home they live in. I think that really puts the wealth of these devices into perspective.

Apple is interesting in the sense that it began to lead the American market, when historically that position belonged to large industrial institutions like General Electric or General Motors. Frankly, it makes sense that it leads. They sell personal devices and services with those devices. It helps to think of those devices as "vehicles to services". This is also what makes the growth of Tesla particularly legendary, since it became that "next generation disruptor" with relatively extreme lifetime value.

As a side note, One interesting practice I like to do is look at the top companies over time and observe the nature of market leaders. There is a degree of common sense there: industrials, technology and financials tend to lead the market. It is the natural economy of global society. I think this is a good practice for understanding the macroeconomic side of the market. You should almost always understand what makes market leaders lead, because it is **always** a profound condition. Then, and only then, is it possible to find other opportunities.

### Conclusion II

Well truthfully, there isn't much to touch on when it comes to incumbents like Berkshire and Apple. They're massive and elite corporations, so it usually just helps to understand how they got there in order to figure out how they're staying there. The smaller businesses are opportunities, but that also requires deep understanding of their relative position in the market.

You may have noticed that I didn't dive much into the financial reporting of these companies. That's because financial reporting is backtracked data. It's the outcome of the understanding and the execution of the business. So it's about keeping up appropriately, but I don't believe in using financial reporting to convince people of a good investment. That part is obvious, you ought to not take too much stake into something with poor or risky financials unless it's you driving the business, but that's a whole other conversation we'll have another day.

As always, you can expect the depth, the details and the quality of this content to improve over time. I believe this is a good faith attempt at getting the most important thoughts on this matter in a clear way and the challenge with this content was thematically always picking out the right parts. Please do take your own time to understand this and apply it to things in and outside of stocks, since it has been multiple and continuous years of effort to consolidate it to this point! I look forward to improving this essay as things change over time :)
