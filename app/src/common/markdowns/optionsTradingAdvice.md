<h3>My advice: don't</h3>
This video should be the foundation to your thinking. The lesson you should learn here is that your brain is designed to make foolish mistakes, which I'm sure you have encountered in your options trading journey at some point.

So my responsibility here is to provide you with insights and experience. There's plenty of information online that will regurgitate the same information regarding trading. Trade this, trade that, and various opinions on the value of options strategies.

This is what I recommend. Be strict in your use and decision to use any investment vehicle. So here are a few guidelines I recommend:

1. Use options when the odds are OVERWHELMINGLY in your favor.

2. Sell for profit, not for optimization. Leaps or not, options are still intensively short-term conditions.

3. Prioritize focus investing before EVER considering options.

If you do this, you will find success with options because you limit the rate of failure that is baked into the investment vehicle. When you deeply understand a business, it is much easier to make appropriate short-term decisions. Most new-hitting information doesn't have a much of a significant impact on the price of a stock. What does are:

1. Overall market conditions

2. Expectations being exceeded or well-managed end-to-end during quarterly earnings reports.

3. Investor sentiment and confidence

You may have heard of the famous stories of options traders gambling during earnings. "The company did so well! But the stock sold off?!?! This market is rigged!!!" This is the voice of someone who is unaware of how options trading works. You must respect the complexity of mathematics, human behaviors, and economic forces in order to utilize options for overall life-time gains.

In short, if you really take these guidelines to heart, you will find more success than failure while trading options. It's almost never a way to build the majority of your wealth, only a way to optimize your already well-researched investments. You can try as hard as you want to reject this advice, but you will find that what I'm telling you here is true.
