These are essays that I wrote when I first started my career as a content creator. I started as a writer on Reddit in May 2020-2021. I had recently started investing in the stock market after many years of market-watching on the sidelines while I went to school and learn computer science.

I think a lot of these early actions are important even if they're outdated. There should be some consistent truth to what I'm saying. The difference should be depth. My introduction to the stock market was through products like Bitcoin, AMD, Paypal, Shopify, Tesla, Facebook and the like from 2016 onward. Not much has changed.

I think it's a great position to be in as a tech investor. I have the benefits of growing up with technology and in some ways I can kind of see that the internet was a child when I was a child and an adult when I was an adult.

It's great to have be on the horizon of seeing these companies perform in the market for that famous "10 year" amount and it's great being a customer of many of these organizations for up to 20 years.

Eventually, these essays will be improved upon - things change. You may see some of the changes already in other Patreon posts. They serve as domains of business or product knowledge. It should help you think about technology more too. Some essays are better than others.

I was writing for an audience that I largely did not care about and was constrained by that relationship. So some sections are more thoughtful than others to serve the relevancy matrix of the forum I was participating in.

The North American rail merger

KSU Panama Canal Rail
TL;DR
The USMCA, a North America trade agreement, was in effect as of July 2020. A railroad merger between US, Canada, and Mexico is in process as of March 2021. The legislation largely considers economic changes since 1994 to allow for greater competition and counterbalance against Eurasian influence.

Cross border trade flows
The USMCA seeks to incentivize various sectors, with most notably, auto-manufacturing. The reason for this is clear, as the industry is orthogonal to critical supply chains in North America:

Cloud computing, IoT, and AI applications
Energy management and utilization.
Operational efficiency in agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and logistics with automation.
Theoretical advancements in financials, digital-trade, cybersecurity, and cross-border trade flows.
Research in biological, material sustainability, and genomics.
Quality of life.

Considering the consequences of furthered development of the above, I would disagree with economists that believe that the USMCA is an ineffective piece of legislation. The reason being is that these advancements have a consequential compouding effect for change over time. Unlike the economists Thea M. Lee or Robert E. Scott of the Economics Policy Institute, I actually have experience as a Mexican-American laborer, rather than a perspective written inside of an ivory tower.

Improvements in cybersecurity and financials, for example, may produce changes in cannabis agriculture, which in turn would increase stability in Mexico. Ideas like these are covered more closely in my Square DD, but it rests as the basis for my disagreement. Mexico is a nation that is ripe for change in a period that strongly seeks change in the global frontier.

Mexico

Mexican-American industrial-tech relationships
Mexico is clearly a nation that warrants many different opinions, as its former governments have failed in a spectacular way to contain the effects of the American drug war. In my view, it’s an issue of economic surpression, where the incentive of black-market goods is far too strong and causes a non-trivial slowdown of national progress.

Trust falling amongst the working class, in a capital system, is dreadfully painful thing to experience with respect to economic growth - the clearest and most visceral being the subject of illegal immigration. A reader may be surprised to hear that Apple Pay has only been available as of 2021 and that just about half of Mexican citizens are underbanked.

Put simply, NAFTA and USMCA are quite literally worlds apart in terms of progress we have been in the past 25 years. Ultimately what this means is that the way to combat it is by overwhelming the black-market industry with strong labor participation. This is effectively agreed upon with the three nations - use Mexico as a proxy competitor to China and as a means to improve international flows like chip and labor shortages.

It is also a strongly stated goal by the Biden administration, Federal Reserve, and Mexican administration; we need to achieve higher labor participation.
At the same time, America is incredibly bullish on the industrial-technological ambitions of Southwestern states like Texas. This is no coincidence, since the states are structured like an economic battleground with tariff incentives where northern Mexican States and southern US states are experiencing a strong period of trade flow synergy with energy and industrial capacities.

The Intercontinental Railroad

Revenue segments
“Now (railroads) is an example of changing our minds. Warren and I have hated railroads our entire life. They're capital-intensive, heavily unionized, with some make-work rules, heavily regulated and long competed with a comparative disadvantage vs. the trucking industry, which has a very efficient method of propulsion (diesel engines) and uses free public roads. Railroads have long been a terrible business and have been lousy for investors. We did finally change our minds and invested. We threw out our paradigms but did it too late. We should have done it two years ago, but we were too stupid to do it at the most ideal time. There's a German saying: Man is too soon old and too late smart. We were too late smart. We finally realized that railroads now have a huge competitive advantage with double-stacked railcars, guided by computers, moving more and more production from China, etc. They have a big advantage over truckers in huge classes of business.”

...
“We said railroads were no damn good. There were too many of them, they had truck competition. And we were right; it was a terrible business for about 80 years. Finally they get down to four big railroads, and it was a better business.”— Charlie Munger

The intent of the railroad is to consider these ambitions and capture the trade from end-to-end.
This comes at a time when organizations like Shopify is one of Canada’s largest financial service providers, or organizations like MercadoLibre massively distributes basic banking services to Latin America and where organizations like Tesla completely transformed multiple sectors.

It also comes during a rather revolutionarily competitive era, where vehicle technology ranging from rockets to traffic flows will produce unknown economies with respect to automation and quality of life. The fundamental equation here is to bring Mexico up to speed. Using this framework, it is clear to understand why North America is driven to produce an intercontinental railroad.

Global trade, as a function of COVID and technological advancements, is experiencing a paradigm shift where cross-border flows, consequences of peace, and other societal demands will effectively never return back to normal. The merger is a representation of such a change.
