### Storytelling Recipe

Explore ideas at a high level. These concepts can be applied to essays, videos, stories, musical orchestrations and so forth. They’re recursions of each other.

#### INTRO (FIRST 2 SECONDS)

Create a hook

1. Set expectations
   Meet the expectations set by the header text and first shot

#### INTRO (FIRST 15 SECONDS)

Create commitment

1. Context
   Make the video make sense

2. Introduce the stakes
   How will you be rewarded for watching?
   How much energy was put into creating this?

3. Knowledge sharing
   What trail or breadcrumbs of information can you provide?

#### BODY

Create engagement

1. Camera motion
   change the space every 2-5 seconds to capture words, thoughts or frames
   Study films like The Titanic to understand things like suspense or emotion

2. Scripts
   Add additional conversations like jokes, flashbacks, or additional narratives
   Have periods where you heat up and cool down the plot. Too much energy is exhausting, not enough energy is boring. Break these into larger subframes of the video that capture a block of scenes.

#### CONCLUSION

Create reward

1. Payoff and reward
   Either introduce the result or complete the result
   End with a tone or message, generally something positive, funny, wholesome etc.

2. Scripts
   Add additional conversations like jokes, flashbacks, or additional narratives
   Have periods where you heat up and cool down the plot. Too much energy is exhausting, not enough energy is boring. Break these into larger subframes of the video that capture a block of scenes.

REVISIONS
Create improvements

Get feedback
Where does it feel stale?
Where does the context lose sense?
Do people’s behavior change while watching something?
Ask for thoughts or reviews

## Content Review (20M+ views)

These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of viral content, the role of community ethos, and the importance of timeliness and relevance.

Here are some summarized points:

#### Viral Videos (1M+ Views)

Positive energy and depth in content matter: High-performing videos often feature optimistic tones and resonate on multiple levels.

Delayed Explosion Phenomenon: Videos can gain traction over time, particularly if they discuss predictably relevant topics or present expert opinions.

Community Matters: Videos that tap into the cultural nuances and collective aspirations of the Latino community perform well.

Egalitarian Tone: Content that speaks to a broad demographic without alienating any particular group tends to succeed.

#### Potential Videos (100k+ Views)

Gamification: Using countdowns and game setups help in holding viewer attention.

Cultural Tones and Imagery: Quick transitions, culturally relevant sounds, and visuals can empower the content.

Cliffhangers and Future Expectations: Creating suspense or future expectations can have significant consequences in terms of engagement.

#### Lessons and Observations

Expert Opinions Matter: If your content can predict future relevance, it can continue to gain traction long after its initial release.

Tap Into Soft Spots: Videos that speak to the hearts of the community ("help the single moms first bro") perform well.

Be Mindful of Tone: Striking the right balance of empowerment, inspiration, and curiosity can be a strong formula for success.

High-Stakes Claims: Make big, audacious claims but back them up to avoid the scammer label.

Political and Controversial Content
Negativity: It plays a role, especially in political landscapes.

Radical Speech: It can be impactful and resonate with many, but should be used cautiously given its double-edged nature.

<!-- ## Interaction & Design

So first and foremost, UI/UX is short for user interfaces and user experiences. It’s a multi-disciplinary research and design skill based on the study of human-computer interaction. It’s an excellent skill to have as it can take many different shapes and sizes. For our intents and purposes, let’s define this skill as “Interaction Design” or simply “Design”.

Some people refer to this profession as the psychology of technology or the therapy of technology. This is because an interaction designer is going to be interviewing and observing a lot of real input from people to gather deeper insights into a product. They will hold surveys, polls, interviews and any number of ways to communicate to people in order to accomplish this.

The key thing I want to highlight in this lecture is that this design work extends far beyond visual design and brainstorming good or clever ideas. It’s an incredibly thoughtful practice that can be applied to many environments. An interaction designer enjoys solving these types of questions

How do you improve this restaurant’s experience?
Do AirBnB hosts who value this skill perform better?
Which trailer in a movie produces the most anticipation?
Which video title is more likely to go viral?

As you can see, this skill, combined with some technical or business acumen, can be a pretty powerful amplifier!

#### Accessibility

Let’s start with accessibility, one of my favorite subjects as an engineer. In the study of computer science, we tend to approach problem-solving by accounting for the worst possible outcome. We do it as a way to practice building scalable solutions with information and data. Accessibility is a subject that has us working with design principles in that matter.

So let’s start with a basic website. It will have all the familiar bells and whistles that we’re used to; some navigation, some buttons and some text inputs. So what else does an interaction designer take a look at other than placing familiar elements on a screen?

Well, let’s consider folks that are blind. They interact with applications using intelligent tools and screen readers. So now we have to consider organizing the information in a way that makes sense for both visual and auditory users.

Now the real benefit to this approach is that it’s often a win-win situation. Thoughtful creation for folks that experience limitations with accessibility often benefits folks without the limitation. For example, if a video lecture is organized in an effective way for blind folks, then people who are tuning in with just headphones can also experience information meaningfully! It’s considerations like this that made things like radio and podcasts such popular media formats for people of all backgrounds to consume.

Multidisciplinary
So hopefully that conversation has you curious about what design even means. You may notice there’s an umbrella of sorts covering a lot of topics. This is because human-computer interaction is fundamentally multidisciplinary. We tend to just talk about it within the context of technology given that technology is also multidisciplinary.

However, it’s all the same as a chemical engineer, a business owner, an architect or even a teacher and still find enormous value integrating the principles of design in your work.

The choices you make have a serious impact. The key words you choose can influence how search engines and social media algorithms distribute your material or how it gets consumed by an audience. The intent behind the features or expressions that you create can affect how successful retention is. It can give you a significant competitive advantage.

Because of the scale of the umbrella, it can be easy to justify something as “good or bad design”. It lends itself to opinion. The best design tends to be whatever makes the people you’re designing for happy and if you want to make even more people happy, well, you’re gonna have to talk to them! The rest is just research, and research is largely meant for discovery.

Many folks may go in another direction, where they start with the discovery part first and then try to convince folks that their solution is superior in some way. Nascent technologies like cryptocurrencies are notorious for this.

However, the study of design also lends itself to the study of new technologies. So hype waves around things like Bitcoin or artificial intelligence is a great time for newcomers to jump in and make contributions toward large problems.

#### Heuristics

Heuristics are essentially guidelines you can use while you create something with constraints or limited feedback. Some things are inevitably repeatable, like considering how a user can correct a mistake or malfunction. These are simply guidelines rather than rules or regulations. There’s an added benefit since they have a tendency to build or bounce off of another.

And these guidelines really introduce you to the practice of interaction design. It’s at this point where you start to learn lower level concepts like the usage of affordances, which are the signals or properties of an object and how that informs a user of its possibilities or potential use cases.

In a rather absurd sense, these concepts are the things that remind you that a water pitcher is meant for pouring water rather than it being a glove to protect your hand. They’re the details that help us realize that pixels on a screen are supposed to represent buttons that we can interact with.

And if you take some time to ponder that idea, you can really start to appreciate the little things in design. Why is that when we see a glove, we know it’s meant to protect our hands? What inspired a fork and a pair of chopsticks? Why did the iPhone get rid of the headphone jack?!

#### Design Systems

So let’s take a step back and review. We value accessibility because it’s fundamentally about enabling more people to do things. We understand that design research is multidisciplinary and encourages us to talk to people directly to gain more insight. We use guidelines to give us a sense of direction when developing ideas or products.

With these fundamentals in mind, it’s worth reviewing the number of ways you can gather insight or communicate your ideas. Much like engineering, your tool of choice is going to carry tradeoffs and consequences.

For example, the usage of paper prototypes may range wildly based on where it’s being seen - a boardroom and a Tiktok video carry different results. Finding the resources and budget to surveying may lead to skewed or biased results. Doing personal interviews may mislead your direction and be costly on a schedule. You may like a cheap tool you found on the internet more than some fancy enterprise software.

But over time you start you start to find what works well with you or with different teams. And it’s here where I can only advise you to think critically and keep an open mind.

#### Further Reading

Now if you enjoyed this subject, I highly recommend a few more follow-up sources. It’s worth your time to check out “The Design of Everyday Things” by Don Norman, who is widely revered in the field of human-computer interaction.

I also recommend using the resources available at nngroup.com, which is the Nielsen Norman Group. This is a knowledge base meant for the profession concerned with standards.

If you’re curious to see what real-world UX research looks like, you’re encouraged to join Bitcoin.design, which is an open-source platform that supports usability research & development for Bitcoin.

These three resources in combination will provide a deeper introduction into the process andd perspective of a designer. -->

# SEO

I don't have a formal background in this. I became aware of SEO back in 2014, shortly after my brother had graduated from college in marketing and communications.

I became more familiar with it deeper into my career and began to apply it more to grow rapidly on with Robots Building Education on Tiktok. I'm going to give you some general purpose foundations, but we'll use Google as a specific examples.

Here's one foundation:

Every social media platform ranks things differently. Most social media platforms have a predictable algorithm based on the data it tries to collect and use to incentivize participation in a social network.

Sheilf, what does that mean? In almost all cases, social media platforms greatly rank their title properties:

LinkedIn professional titles
The text hooks people include in tiktok introductions
Google website titles and descriptions
There are a number of things that you can do to "shape" the direction of search, but they're usually not nearly as impact as the actual product that you're issuing out into the world.

Think of it this way, using a hashtag like #computerscience is the equivalent to adding a label to a product. Now, what actually matters more in the business world: the product being purchased or the labels on it?

Once you really understand how generally simple it is, e.g a business like LinkedIn is obviously going to care about job titles more than anything, you can start strategizing.

Auto Detailing In LA and San Bernardino

So I had a 1-on-1 meeting with someone this weekend and we went over SEO for a business he's creating. The ask was "how do we get my business populating better on Google".

So first thing we have to ask is, "what do people search when they search for this kind of business?"

We can take an educated guess that people will likely prompt "<Product Needed>[Location]", so in this case it would be "Auto detailing San Bernardino"
<br/>
<img src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/41283ab8-33e6-4ab3-ae6f-7223f4438076" width="100%">
<br/>

We can see that this results aren't that competitive. Now let's think about Google as a business again. It's a mini library for the internet, it's also a business that must grow and profit, and it has limited context.

There's also another massive iceberg underneath, where google is likely able to process a number of details about your business and company. Services like Wix or other SEO providers likely make it easier by "wiring" some of these things up - but you can never really undervalue the level of engineering going on behind some of these platforms. For example, it's likely that Google measures how quickly your app will load as part of its ranking reccommendation or the location of the searcher.

Anyway, let's keep things simple - Google has a limited amount of context to compare. You have the website, a title, and them some website descriptions. So what happens if I look up something like Lebron James or better yet, Sheilfer? Well now you can see Google's business machine more clearly.
<br/>
<img src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/3925ef4f-8224-428d-a3ba-b3a67db7ee3d" width="100%">

What you get are ads, wikipedia, social media, public media and not lebronjames.com. So what does that mean for you and your business?

This is what I recommend, very simply:

Understand what words best describe your line of business
Create a network of the words across various social media platforms.
Don't be afraid to experiment with titles. Changing your SEO is like changing your headquarters.

This is a great example of what not to do:

## Influence & Expression

<!-- <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1676193809/1_lqmbjj.jpg" /> -->

So before beginning, let’s quickly go through my experience on the subject. I’ve been using internet forums for about 20 years. The first one I really participated in was called GameFAQs.

The first time I was ever introduced to search engine optimization (SEO) was through my brother after he completed a bachelors in marketing and communications in 2014. SEO is a marketing technology that people use to understand and grow their rank, relevance, and recommendation results on platforms like Google or Tiktok.

That’s what internet forums and social media are - they’re communication experiences built on top of communication technology. To reinforce that knowledge, I studied computer science with a focus on human-computer interaction, which you may recognize as user interface design and user experience research.

To me, social media is an expression of a generational barrier. It’s one of those things you can get good at so that you can move on to bigger ideas in your life.

Clearly, internet forums change in shape and format and this is something that an organization like Meta tries to account for. These days I have quite the appreciation for the algorithmic experiences driven by platforms like TikTok and Pinterest.

It’s intersectional with a lot of the things I’ve studied formally. If you’re going to remember one thing from this bit of knowledge, you ought to remember that things are sorted by what the platform considers relevant.

Social media algorithms are informed by their design. For Twitter, it’s your voice in a global chatroom. For Pinterest, it’s ideas, planning and shopping. You get the point. Pinterest will never be as effective of a political platform as a place like Twitter and Twitter will not really capture the essence of women’s shopping needs the same way either.

I think many of us grew up in a time where we differentiated between Google Search and some Social Media, but the truth is they have all always been the same at the consumer level. It’s us connecting information on communication platforms.

Tangentially, I’m a big believer in the metaverse. Online gaming has always been on the cutting edge of communication technology and experiences. To me, the metaverse is computing built from a social perspective rather than the default mode we got, which was personal computing.

It is a social computer. We aren’t really used to it just yet, but some of the ways we do things today will be seen as really clunky or limited. I imagine that a social computer is largely driven by experiences and AI, which if you pause to ponder, is what drives social media today.

Well, these experiences will continue to expand in depth, as we’ve seen with conversational AIs and AI artistry in recent months.

As a result of this relevance-dominant communication, many of us will often start by using naive advice. You’ve heard it all before:

Use a select amount of hashtags

Follow trends

Find a niche

Find a theme

Use an effective hook, body, and call to action

Use keywords and captions for SEO

Use a social media strategy

BE AUTHENTIC!

All of these are true enough that they’re worth practicing to a degree, but they aren’t clear drivers for growth. They’re practices. Growth requires an intersectional understanding between the nature of media, its consumers and its producers. Here are some other pieces of advice you may not often hear at the naive level:

Sex sells

Opinions create conversations

Disagreements create conditions for success

Be psychologically aware of your audience’s collective unconscious

Embed archetypical thoughts

Master ability to title and brand

These are true for the same reason - we’re participating in a communication platform.

I could write a book poetically explaining each concept but really that’s all a giant waste of time in comparison to what you really need. So here’s the real secret to growing on social media. You need to decolonize your mind. What the fuck does that mean, man?

This is a complicated thing because it means a lot of different things for different people, and frankly, I’m not the best at it either. So here’s what I know:

A good model to examine is your classic rockstar or an artist like Cardi B. They do things to command a certain presence and attention in and outside of a performance, and the dynamic between the two is what creates a following audience. The key thing is not that they don’t give a fuck.

They care a lot about their image. The key thing is that they allow themselves to express themselves with confidence and will attempt to actualize their ideas strategically and repeatedly. They chase. It’s not easy to show up regularly like that.

One experiment I like to do is to ask an individual whether or not they can create a video and post it publicly while seriously claiming that they can change the world. Many people find that it’s not as easy as it appears in their first take.

One thing that I need to pay attention to as an expert in human-computer interaction is the user experience. It’s synonymous with the human or student experience. This is the ultimate zone of education. A student’s experience is always a multidimensional problem.

Given that most of us are Latino, I think we can all sympathize to a degree that our “Latino experience” is driven by frictional conversations of race, survival, sexuality, history and other cultural concepts. We can all relate to the complex time we live in, where we will have to address significant but personal conversations about clinical depression, ambition, the other so-called “generational curses”.

I try to weave into the conversations that folks ought to examine the quality of their self-esteem and self-talk before addressing clinical subjects. This can either direct them to a healthier life or it can direct them to better handle and manage their clinical experiences.

The difficult point that I’m trying to connect here is that there is an underbelly of shame that is embedded in our cultural and lived experience in the US. That shame harms the quality of our thoughts. Having a good recognition of that is a deeply empowering thing, and in my view, it allows you to expand your voice, expression and resilience.

Some of these instances and the impact of shaming are historically clear, like the public lynching of George Floyd, while others may be pretty subtle, like adoption of a nickname to make life easier. In my view, shame is one of those concepts that drives people to not believe that they can perform in math courses, express themselves as artists or achieve political and financial influence.

It is abundant in the modern day and it’s worthwhile to consider your views and opinions of history, its impact on the modern day and the outlook of the future you envision. History is one of those things that is omnipresent. There is no escaping it.

It’s always being created and you are always participating in it. So it’s a worthwhile thing to reflect on. That’s what “decolonization” is, it’s an attempt to engage outside of your default-mode in your default-setting.

With that being said, the other important thing to do is to iterate and experiment. I’ve recently advised folks to read Shitty First Drafts by Anne Lamott since I feel that is a good starting point to embrace self-expression without concern for vulnerability and imperfection.

It’s easier to continuously iterate, destroy and improve an idea when you have a vision to work toward. Scientists do this. They embrace failure so that they can observe, analyze and improve. The final result is often after a series of different challenges and solutions.

And with the combination of those two things, I feel that it allows creators to create things to influence and inspire because you start to create more soulful or purposeful material. You may start with a niche, but you ought to work hard to break out of that barrier and into a wider domain of knowledge.

If you’re sorting by relevance, you’ll almost always tap into cultural identities, unconscious unities and activist thinking. This is why I usually stand in a position to encourage others. People ought to speak loudly and embrace the consequences of doing so. People should fail faster too.

It’s not easy and some people are better than others in their delivery or interest. But I think this practice allows just about anyone to begin a journey and find success. I think one way or another, any creator ends up going through this process anyway, and awareness of some things is sometimes what allows people to make the leaps that they’re capable of making.

I encourage people often to try to do what is right in alignment with what they seek out of their creative experience. For me, it’s going hard on the paint. FLOCKA.

<!--
So I started working with a few folks in a very minor but significant way. They're creative folks and we're going to just stay in close communication about trying to actively improve with social media.

Truthfully, a big challenge for me is that I have pretty severe ADHD, so it's pretty hard for me to be consistent in ways that some things demand, and really I just try my best to make it work. But like all things, there are tradeoffs. I digress. Let's jump into it.

There are ways to grow as a content creator and as an influencer. I believe there's a significant difference between the two. I will be publishing this in steps, and sending an alert when updates are made. I will make several changes to this post before releasing "officially". However, here's a list and you may use it however you want in the meantime.

---

Videos under 20k:

Usually these videos have some kind of low-effort but useful bent to them. They can be negative, combative, disagreeable, or some kind of pessimistic trait. This is kind of like doing social media on easy-mode, but I believe there may be somewhat of an upper limit to this approach when it comes to influence.

It works, and everyone can kind of relate that negative feelings just kind of have a bias for attention than positive ones, but positive ones are usually way stronger end-games. Are they bad to do? It depends on your case, but I think in terms of min-maxing and growth, you probably don't wanna depend on it because then the algorithm basically wins a round on you and you kinda wanna beat the algorithm. And sometimes these kinds of videos can bubble up.

It doesn't mean that videos that usually perform around 20-50k can't be changed into 200k+ videos. But then again it's that algorithmic bell-curve that kinda informs you about the machine you're working with.

With that noted, I've been doing a general review of my account and have noticed that I tend to just notepad a lot of content. That currently just works with me because I don't have many resources to work with.

---

How I will be taking notes:
I will probably jot down a lot of attributes in a matrix without any order. Just what I think and see and how I categorize a video. I'll add any notable context and I'll write in some data to account for lessons learned or things that may have worked.

"SEO" is short for search-engine optimization. It's an important metric that platforms like Google and Tiktok take into account when trying to "understand a video". There are many things that inform SEO like watch time, and there are other things that are more valuable than others.

For example, text on a screen is weighed more than a caption. The same is true for any social platform. Youtube greatly ranks the title. Linkedin greatly ranks professional titles.

---

Steps Ahead

Redo and repurpose videos. Sometimes a video tweet can be an audio-visual explanation. Sometimes a long explanation can be condensed down to 5 seconds. Do them with the intent of "getting the message right" rather than generating more content.

So primarily ask, "how can I do this a little better with the right amount of resources?" and critically re-examining performance vs. expectation.

Viral Videos (1M+ views)

Summary: as you can see, the best performing videos do not include negative energy. They include positive energy, but there is also a lot of depth behind the words. It's almost obvious in some ways - achieving positive change is difficult. achieving negative change is easy. Awesome is the best.
https://www.tiktok.com/@robotsbuildingeducation/video/7082742762130623790?lang=en

Attributes: [video tweet, short, low-effort, high information demand, low information supply, trending topic, expert analysis, trending sound]

SEO: Elon Musk, CEO, Twitter, invested, crypto

Hook+Delivery: The reason X did Y was because Z. Z is this. This means A for the future.

Lessons learned: I remember this video being "delayed explosion", meaning that it grew to 300k on initial interest of the breaking news, and grew to 3 million after the news was confirmed. So there is more likeliness that a content can be relevant later in a timeline if the content talks about predictably relevant things. Expert opinions on complicated things can be impactful.

Hook+Delivery: idgaf if you relate to A or B, if you wanna learn high value skill, I got you. This is how and where. This is why I think you should. I'm doing this because of these awesome reasons.

Lessons learned: Latinos are egalitarian. If you observe the comments, it's a positive kind of energy, a desire to learn and a desire to share. One comment stood out to me some time ago "help the single moms first bro". You know? We have a soft spot for certain people like the street vendors, moms, little sisters, undocumented people and kids. So I think I tapped into that part of our culture and I tapped into the part where it's like, and so what? we are still awesome and life is good. life is fun.

SEO: Mexican, Pro Tip, Graduating, Job, Cheap

Hook+Delivery: This is what got me <awesome things> with <less than average resources>. Here's how. Countdown + game setup.

Lessons learned: I always remembered this video and considered it possibly my best tiktok video of all time. Everything about it "just right". There are some things that can be tweaked to push for better results but I think something like this, and what's happening "under the hood" is a great demonstration. Countdowns are also a powerful thing, as it can often immerse a viewer into the subject. Even the music was game boss style.

Hook+Delivery: Hey, psst. Wait hold on. Isn't that much better? So here's the deal. Capiche?

Lessons learned: This video has really strong cultural tones and creates an immersive enough experience with it. There isn't much to say here. This could have been a lazy
video tweet video, but quick transitions and loaded imagery empowered the words.

Hook+Delivery: Actually, difficult task is easy. In fact, it can be done this quickly and jokingly easily. Give me some time and I will show you. This is your sign

Lessons learned: This video is a good demonstration of using some mechanical things about the tiktok algorithm, like a trending video style and really strong communication to create a hook, promise or delivery. One powerful thing to note here is that creating expectations in the future can sometimes have significant consequences, which we may sometimes recognize as cliffhangers.

Hook+Delivery: Fun fact bout this silly shi, real shi huh? eyeroll

Lessons learned: Eh, like stated before, some negative videos can bubble up and there isn't anything particularly notable about the video that can't be found in other videos. I suppose the potential here is that there can be a broader conversation around empowering women, which is something that unfolded in the comment section in some ways.

Hook+Delivery: yo, if you're in this inner group, hmu i'll hook you up [you implicitly know this is gonna deliver]. Heres how, what, and the results. Or you can do this
with it instead.

Lessons learned: There's a lot that's going on here and it was consequential for a period of growth. I started combining video tweets with mini-music videos with zoom filters. It adds a level of fun, immersion and vulnerability to the video. It's at this point too where I started building things outside of Tiktok, so there were stronger calls to action. People want to feel the hook up. I started tapping into the egalitarian side of the culture. These days, I just use it for fun now.

I started talking to Roxana more here. Obviously at the surface level, people see her beauty and kind of come up with their conclusions. Our conversations quickly became about social media. She had an interesting command over confidence and I was endlessly amused by how she would direct people to click a link that lead to overthrowing dictators. I consider this point where my videos started creating with more with feminine tones.

Often times I'll miss. You know, a little too strong on some tones or too light in others. But getting it right is usually a strong message of empowerment and encouragement. That goes amazingly with inspiration and curiosity. At this point now, I'll definitely overrepresent for Latinas and undocumented folks. It's just solves fundamental problems more effectively. If you can represent Latinas and undocumented folks well, you can represent all of Latin America well.

Attributes: [audio-visual, explanation, stock, gamified, disagreeable, combative]

SEO: Showing Mexicans How To,

Hook+Delivery: Showing You How To Make Thousands With $50 - common enemy won't tell you this but, the way to achieve mysterious generational challenge is this way.

Lessons learned: This video had me recognized by some folks with a strong institutional background regarding Hispanic wealth. But frankly, if you look at the video, the hook is pretty ridiculous and the delivery still succeeds to demonstrate.

So there's a very real relationship with the claim you're making and how well you can address it. At worst, you're viewed as a scammer. At best, you're viewed as someone rather talented. So go big. There is no option to go home.

On a related note, I'm pretty familiar with the stock market community. These people are usually pretty brash and disagreeable. Sometimes being kind is great, I've done that before and people liked to see humble winnings.

But usually, the stock market is full of opinionated amateurs who are likely overleveraged with bias in their decisions. I mean, if you're gonna disagree, you better try winning the disagreement. I don't recommend disagreeing without an unfair advantage usually.

This video likely has potential to break past 1 million views on the premise alone. So it should be foundational for future stock videos. The stock market is also gamified - so with enough show business, the videos are above-average in their level of attention grabbing and immersion.

It actually makes me wonder if some of my animated videos would perform better with me present`in a green screen just because we prefer that kind of human proximity. It's not intuitive, you would think people like to show just see an animation - but think about it, we fuck people.

Hook+Delivery: In Group wants to unify this because of this trend, but when it really matters, we don't. If we look at the big picture, we undermine our potential.

Lessons learned: This was an interesting and temporary pivot I took when I started to make political content during the political midterms. So the topic was strongly
trending depending on your location and it almost felt like I was teleporting to Houston in some ways.

Negativity, in politics, is pretty effective and I would consider negative energy to be necessary in this space. Everyone loses in politics - the nature of it is for you to lose one way or the other. So it's a matter of picking what hills you want to fight for and to bring the fight to those hills.

I also engaged in light use of radical politics and propaganda by slurring racist words and stereotypes. I am a huge fan of this for oppressed people finding themselves debating in primarily white institutions. The repurposing words carry power and trauma that is difficult for opponents to handle.

Hook+Delivery: In Group will often forget this, but here is a reminder of an truly unforgettable thing.

Lessons learned: There's a lot to say here. Many people appreciate my ability to create or understand patterns and this post was probably the most cathartic one I'll create. It's something that I felt strongly for years and would often repeat it.
I feel that Trump is genuinely responsible for the El Paso shooting and the events, like the Capitol riots, that transpired after it are no coincidence. The data is evident that instigating political violence was the primary agenda to technocratically control the conversation and direction of politics.

I'm happy that it went viral the way that it did and for me it was partially healing. I hope to repeat the message here often in the future. It is in line with my belie that radical speech ought to be used to create progress.

SEO: Latino dropout, nursing, Latina, grad school, Mexican, first, family business, $1,000, January, Sunday, 2023, Bad Bunny, Juan Gabriel, email, story, vision, future, apply

Lessons learned: My ADHD absolutely maxed out here. It is ridiculously difficult for me to write anything but this video is mostly a repeat of a previous successful coloring of a video with egalitarian tones.

And that's really the goal, we want that repeatable success of a video that is effective to do and maximizes impact. There's has to be ways to achieve it and reasons for failure.

It makes me think a lot though about the machine. Like how much more successful, on average, is a video that mentions Juan Gabriel than does not? Juan Gabriel has a supernatural influence over the culture. But at what point does leveraging that benefit become stale, dishonest and robotic?
